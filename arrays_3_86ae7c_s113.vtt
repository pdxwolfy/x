00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.720
This exercise has given us an array

2
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.720
and we're asked to return
the string example from this array.

3
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.680
So taking a closer look, you can see
that this array has two elements.

4
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.320
Each of those elements is also an array.

5
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.360
The first element is an array
that contains three strings.

6
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.440
And the second element is an array

7
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.040
that contains two elements,
which are also strings.

8
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:38.840
And you can see that the string example is
the first element in the second sub array.

9
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.400
We can access this second
element in our two element array

10
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.600
with the array last method.

11
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:55.120
So I'm going to use P to output that
and let's run our code and see that.

12
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:08.160
So now we see the last element of our
array, ah, which is a two element array

13
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.840
example, is the first
element of this array.

14
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.520
Knowing that we want to return the string

15
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.000
example, we can simply chain a method
called to the array first method.

16
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.160
This will return the first element

17
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:34.040
of the last element of the array,
let's output this.

18
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.960
And we see the stirring example,

19
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.200
you can read about these array methods

20
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.120
and more in the ruby documentation
for the array class.
