00:00:03.641 --> 00:00:05.641
We've been given some code

00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:07.544
and this exercise asks us

00:00:07.616 --> 00:00:11.410
what the each method in this code will return

00:00:11.484 --> 00:00:13.484
after it's finished executing

00:00:14.572 --> 00:00:17.823
So we call the each method on the variable x

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:19.976
which references an array

00:00:23.396 --> 00:00:28.259
We can determine the return value of a method by looking a the ruby documentation

00:00:28.867 --> 00:00:33.156
In this case, we will look at the documentation for the Array#each method

00:00:34.071 --> 00:00:39.728
We can also copy this code and paste it into IRB to see the return value

00:00:41.115 --> 00:00:43.115
So I'll open up IRB

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.630
Paste in the code

00:00:46.076 --> 00:00:49.632
And when I hit Enter, we can see that the original collection

00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:53.920
the array on which we invoked each, is returned

00:00:54.897 --> 00:00:59.467
Each will always return the original array, the array that it was called on
